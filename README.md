# Transactions/Finance Tracker in React Native
# Go to /app/(tabs)/index.tsx to see most relevant code (home page)

This is a React Native app which can run on iOS that will allow the user to view account balance as well as money spent. The user can add transactions (money spent and earned), and can undo these changes. The user can see a scrollable history with date timestamps showing all previous transactions. The user can also reset the app to start back with no transactions.
